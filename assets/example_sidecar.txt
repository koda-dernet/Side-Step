# Side-Step Sidecar Metadata Example
#
# Place a .txt file next to each audio file with the SAME name:
#   my_song.wav  →  my_song.txt
#
# All fields are optional. Side-Step will use sensible defaults
# for anything you leave out (e.g. caption derived from filename,
# lyrics set to [Instrumental]).
#
# These values are used to build the text prompt that the model
# trains on — they are NOT stored as raw key: value pairs in the
# tensor. The format matches upstream ACE-Step exactly.
#
# ── Required by the model (highly recommended) ──────────────────
caption: A dreamy lo-fi ambient track with warm pads and soft rain
#
# ── Musical metadata (improves prompt quality) ──────────────────
genre: ambient, lo-fi
bpm: 85
key: C minor
signature: 4/4
#
# ── Lyrics (leave out or set to [Instrumental] for instrumentals)
# Multi-line: everything after "lyrics:" until the next key or EOF.
lyrics:
[Verse]
Raindrops on the window pane
Soft echoes down the lane

[Chorus]
Drifting through the haze
Lost in purple days
